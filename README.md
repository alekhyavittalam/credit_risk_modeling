# üè¶ Credit Risk Modeling with XGBoost

This project builds a credit risk scoring model to predict the probability of default for loan applicants. Using the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset from Kaggle, we simulate a real-world credit scoring pipeline ‚Äî from preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and interpretability.

## üîç Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to assess the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan. Misclassifying risky borrowers can result in financial losses, while rejecting creditworthy applicants can impact revenue and customer experience.

This project aims to:
- Predict loan default (binary classification)
- Balance sensitivity (catching defaulters) and specificity (not rejecting good customers)
- Provide model interpretability using SHAP
- Assign risk tiers for decision support (approve / manual review / reject)

## üì¶ Dataset

- **Source**: [Give Me Some Credit ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit)
- **Target variable**: `SeriousDlqin2yrs` (1 = defaulted, 0 = non-default)
- **Features include**: revolving credit utilization, number of delinquencies, debt ratio, etc.

## üîß Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Imputation using median strategy
   - Weight of Evidence (WOE) encoding for interpretability
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Class imbalance visualization
   - Distribution plots of key features

3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression (baseline)
   - XGBoost with `scale_pos_weight` to handle class imbalance
   - Threshold tuning for better recall vs precision trade-off

4. **Evaluation**
   - AUC, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall Curve
   - Custom threshold selection based on business needs

5. **Interpretability**
   - SHAP summary plots to show global feature importance
   - SHAP waterfall plot to explain individual predictions

6. **Risk Tiers**
   - Probabilistic classification into:
     - Low Risk (Approve)
     - Medium Risk (Manual Review)
     - High Risk (Reject)
